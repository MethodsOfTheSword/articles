This document is a stress test for the site's styling, ensuring all elements render correctly after recent CSS updates. We begin with a regular paragraph to check the default font, line height, and the new **1.5rem** paragraph margins.

## 1. Headings and Horizontal Rules

### 1.1 The En Garde Stance (H3)

A quick review of the basic footwork principles. We should see the small-caps font-variant and increased letter-spacing on this H3.

#### 1.1.1 Foot Position (H4)

A final level of heading to ensure visual hierarchy is preserved.

## 2. Text Styling and Emphasis

We must be precise in our movements, avoiding unnecessary motions.

* The **Foil** requires a specific grip. (Check bolding)
* *Footwork tempo* is critical for surprise attacks. (Check italics)
* Use a **thrust** for the **lunge**. (Check combination)
* Always parry **Quarte** (`P4`). (Check inline code)
* The touch was awarded to the $\text{attacker}$. (Check inline $\LaTeX$)

A *highly critical* concept is the **Point in Line** (PiL). The margin for error is small, approximately **25 millimeters** (1 inch).

> **Note:** Proper timing is achieved only through rigorous practice. Never skip your warm-up.

## 3. Lists and Definition Terms

### 3.1 Unordered List (Basic)

Ensure the Tufte-style **"▪"** bullet marker is visible and colored with `var(--accent-color)`.

* Advance with control.
* Retreat without panic.
* Lunge with commitment.

### 3.2 Ordered List (Footwork Sequence)

Check the large left padding for the numbering.

1.  Initial *preparation* (check italic inside ordered list).
2.  The *feint* (requires speed).
3.  The **attack** (should be definitive).

### 3.3 Definition List (Glossary Check)

We must define key terms for new students.

<dl>
    <dt>Flèche</dt>
    <dd>An aggressive attack involving a forward run, popular in Epée and Sabre.</dd>

    <dt>Riposte</dt>
    <dd>The retaliatory attack made by the defender after they have successfully parried.</dd>
</dl>

## 4. Code Blocks and Blockquotes

### 4.1 A Critical Historical Quote (Blockquote)

The background color, accent border, padding, and margin must be correct. The margin should be `2rem 0`.

> *Il modo d'impugnare l'arma costituisce l'abbiccí della scherma, e se qualcuno, fosse pure un campione, non vi ha mai badato, farà bene a ricredersi, e ad ascoltare i consigli che impartisce un maestro insuperabile, Nedo Nadi, a proposito del fioretto.*

> *(This quote is a test of the margin-top/bottom issue with nested paragraphs.)*

### 4.2 Example Drill Code (Fenced Code Block)

Testing the `pre` element styling: background color, border radius, and font.

```python
# Drill sequence: Lunge, Retreat, Parry Quarte
def drill_001(fencer, target):
    fencer.lunge(target)
    fencer.retreat(1)
    fencer.parry('Quarte')

# Ensure this block uses the monospace font and light grey background.
